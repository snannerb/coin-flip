## Project Plan

### **Project Plan: Fortune Teller App**

#### **1. Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to develop a simple Fortune Teller app with a single button that generates and displays a random "Yes" or "No" response upon being clicked. The app will have a minimalistic user interface and will be lightweight and easy to use.

---

#### **2. Main Tasks**
**Task 1: Define Requirements and Scope**
- Finalize app functionality and constraints.
- Confirm the target platform (e.g., mobile, web).

**Task 2: Design the User Interface**
- Create a wireframe for the app:
  - A single button labeled "Ask Fortune Teller."
  - A clear area to display the response ("Yes" or "No").
- Ensure the design is simple and intuitive.

**Task 3: Implement the Random Response Logic**
- Develop the logic to randomly generate "Yes" or "No" with equal probability.
- Integrate the logic with the button click event.

**Task 4: Develop the App**
- Build the app using the chosen technology stack (e.g., React for web, Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android).
- Implement the UI and random response logic.

**Task 5: Test the App**
- Test the app to ensure:
  - The button click generates a random response.
  - The response is displayed correctly.
  - The app is lightweight and responsive.

**Task 6: Deploy the App**
- Deploy the app to the desired platform (e.g., App Store, Google Play, or a web server).
- Ensure the app is accessible and functional for end users.

---

#### **3. Technical Considerations**
**UI Design:**
- Use a clean and minimalistic design.
- Ensure the button and response area are prominently displayed.
- Consider accessibility (e.g., font size, color contrast).

**Randomization Logic:**
- Use a random number generator to produce a 50/50 chance of "Yes" or "No."
- Example: Generate a random number (0 or 1) and map 0 to "No" and 1 to "Yes."

**Platform-Specific Development:**
- For **web apps**: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React).
- For **mobile apps**: Use native development tools (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) or cross-platform frameworks (Flutter, React Native).

**Testing:**
- Perform unit testing for the randomization logic.
- Conduct user testing to ensure the app is intuitive and functional.

**Deployment:**
- For **web apps**: Host on a reliable server (e.g., AWS, Netlify).
- For **mobile apps**: Follow platform-specific guidelines for app store submission.
